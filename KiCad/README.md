# Circuit Boards

Initial draft *untested* version ot a new PDB allowing UART control of the TMC2209.

The version also includes a connection for a [GPS module](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps) and a [Temperature and Pressure Sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-am2320-temperature-humidity-i2c-sensor)connected to the I2C bus of the Pi. The board also has two buttons (HOME and STOP) connected to the Pi GPIOs for future use. 

Use at your own risk :)
