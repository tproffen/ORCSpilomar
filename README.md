# pi-lomar

## ORCSGirls version

We build this project with one of our students. This is the home for some of the code modifications. 

* Change driver to TMC2209 and control via UART
* New draft PCB to enable UART control of the stepper controllers.

## Based on this project

RaspberryPi based miniature observatory.
A Python3 project to control a small camera and telephoto lens housed in a miniature 3D printed observatory enclosure.
This combines multiple open modules to handle object location, tracking and image capture.

This uses Python3 on the Raspberry Pi and CircuitPython on a connected Pimoroni Tiny2040/Tiny2350 microcontroller.

The physical telescope, mechanism and dome is buildable from the Instructables page.
